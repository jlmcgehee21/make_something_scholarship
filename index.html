            My career path has led me to a place where I work in developing software
            systems with Artificial Intelligence capabilities.  I know for a fact that
            the technology already exists to replace a large number of human workers,
            and it is only a matter of time before many unskilled workers are unfortunately
            "unemployable".  Now, more than ever, the success of a young person's career
            depends on their ability to "make something" creative and useful that is
            beyond the capabilities of Artificial Intelligence.
